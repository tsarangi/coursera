      But I must explain to you how all this mistaken 
      idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain 
      was born and I will give you a complete 
      account of the system, and expound the actual 
      teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
      the master-builder of human happiness. 
      No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
      because it is pleasure, 
      but because those who do not know how to pursue 
      pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
      that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
      anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain 
      pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally 
      circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
      procure him some great pleasure. To take a 
      trivial example, which of us ever undertakes 
      laborious physical exercise, except to obtain 
      some advantage from it? But who has any right 
      to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy 
      a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
      or one who avoids a pain that produces no 
      resultant pleasure? [33] On the other hand, 
      we denounce with righteous indignation and 
      dislike men who are so beguiled and 
      demoralized by the charms of pleasure 
      of the moment, so blinded by desire, that 
      they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that 
      are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to 
      those who fail in their duty through weakness of 
      will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
      from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
       and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our 
       power of choice is untrammeled and when 
       nothing prevents our being able to do what 
       we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and 
       every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
       and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
       of business it will frequently occur that pleasures 
       have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
       The wise man therefore always holds in these 
       matters to this principle of selection: 
       he rejects pleasures to secure other greater 
       pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse.
